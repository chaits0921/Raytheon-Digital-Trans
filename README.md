# Raytheon Digital Transformation 

This is our project for the data science independent study course ( CS 696: Industry Mentorship Independent Study) at UMass Amherst for spring 2020. 

Abstract:

Digital Transformation is the use of new, fast and frequently changing digital technology to solve problems. In this project, we are interested to know which sectors of S&P 500 are the most active in acquiring other specialized companies in the digital transformation space. Furthermore, we wish to identify the companies conducting significant acquisitions in their respective sectors and to see if there is a evident trend of acquisitions in certain sectors. Consequently, we wish to check if it is possible to predict the acquisitions of companies and we are exploring this problem by looking at the past acquisitions made by the S&P 500 companies. We have employed a combination of a neural network and a decision tree to produce a soft decision tree approach to this problem and have achieved an accuracy around 80% on our test data.
